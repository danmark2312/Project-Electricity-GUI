    ATTENTION: this function inputs 'tvec', because it is a criteria. Even though
        it is not actually being used...

    Displays some descriptive statistics and outputs them as a
    table for the user to see

    INPUT:
        tvec: N x 6 matrix where each row is a time vector
        data: N x 4 matrix where each row is a set of measurements

    OUTPUT:
        stat: dataFrame containing descriptive statistics of data matrix

    USAGE:
        stat = print_statistics(tvec,data)
